- **CRITICAL DESIGN REQUIREMENT:** All visual elements, components, and UI implementations in this project MUST strictly adhere to:
  1. **Apple-esque Design Principles:** Clean, minimalist aesthetics with careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle animations
  2. **Vercel Design System:** Follow Vercel's official design guidelines at https://vercel.com/design/guidelines

  This is a non-negotiable requirement. Every UI change must be evaluated against these design standards before implementation.
